'''
Requires:
This function needs the module "netaddr"

What it does:
Takes text and converts to an IPNetwork object (as defined in the netaddr  
module) to lists all the valid IP addresses in that network. 
Valid in this case means that the IP representing the network (the first one 
in the range) and the broadcast (the last on in the range) are not listed.
There are exceptions though:
 - in networks with /31 and /32 mask all IP addresses are valid, so are printed

 How to use
 network = '192.168.12.0/29'
